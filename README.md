##Overview

The Real-time Exercise Rep Counter is a computer vision project designed to count exercise repetitions in real-time using video input. Leveraging the power of OpenCV and MediaPipe, this system detects and tracks human poses, particularly focusing on exercises involving dumbbells.

##Key features of the project include:

#Real-time Pose Detection: Utilizes MediaPipe to accurately detect and track human poses in video streams.
Rep Counting: Counts the number of exercise repetitions performed by the user in real-time.
#Visual Feedback: Provides visual feedback by overlaying detected poses and rep count on the video stream.
#Easy-to-use Implementation: Offers a simple and straightforward implementation for easy setup and usage.
With its ability to provide instant feedback on exercise performance, the Real-time Exercise Rep Counter is a valuable tool for fitness enthusiasts, trainers, and anyone looking to monitor and improve their workout routines.
